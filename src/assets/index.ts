// Export all assets from here for consistent imports

// This file serves as a centralized location for all assets
// It helps with organization and makes imports cleaner throughout the app

// Example: 
// import { logoImage, heroBackground } from '@/assets';

// Placeholder for future assets
export const placeholderImage = '/placeholder.svg';

// Add more assets as needed
